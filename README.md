# Customer Persona Analysis for E-commerce Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset from an e-commerce platform to create detailed customer personas. By examining key features such as `InvoiceNo`, `Description`, `InvoiceDate`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, and `CustomerID`, we aim to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. Understanding these personas can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, enhance customer engagement, and ultimately drive sales.

- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time when the purchase was made.
- **Quantity**: Number of items purchased in a transaction.
- **UnitPrice**: Price per individual item.
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand trends and patterns in customer purchases.
